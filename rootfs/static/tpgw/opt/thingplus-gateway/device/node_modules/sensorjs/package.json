  "readme": "# sensorjs\n\nThis module handles all about sensor with powerful and familiar techs.\nIn other words this sensorjs is not only sensor driver module but also framework like express.\n\nAnd it's working on linux boards such as the BeagleBone or Raspberry Pi.\n\n![gateway](https://raw.github.com/daliworks/sensorjs/master/doc/image/gateway.png \"gateway\")\n\n[Here](https://github.com/daliworks/sensorjs/blob/master/lib/sensor/README.md) is currently available sensors.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install sensorjs \n\n## sensor.js URL scheme\n### sensorjs://[{gateway}]/{sensor network}[:{bus id}]/{address}/{sensor model}/{sensor id}\n - example\n    - ```sensorjs:///ble/000A3A58F310/dht22/22-000003a7f590```\n    - ```sensorjs:///i2c:1/33/dht33/22-000003a7f590```\n    - ```sensorjs:///gpio/22/singleled/r222```\n\n## Example\n```js\nvar connect = require('sensorjs'),\n   sensorDriver = connect.sensor;\n\nvar app = connect().\n  use(connect.filter({$between: [-50, 50]})).  // filter: passing between -50 and 50\n  use(connect.average(20 /*duration*/)).  // reduce: values to an average every 20 sec.\n  use(function (data, next) {  // custom middleware\n    if (Math.max.apply(null, data.queue) < data.value) {\n      console.log('new record', data.value);\n    } \n    next();\n  }).\n  use(connect.queue(100)).                   // buffering max # of 100.\n  use('/w1/*/ds18b20', function (data, next) {\n    if (data.value > 20) {\n      console.log('getting hot:', data.value);\n    }\n    next();\n  }).\n  use('/gpio/*/dht11', function (data, next) {\n    if (data.value < 30) {\n      console.log('getting dry:', data.value);\n    }\n    next();\n  });\n  // transport(mqtt, localStorage, websocket and etc)\n  //use(connect.websocket('http://yourhost.com', 'temperature/{id}'/*topic*/));\n```\nMore examples are [here](https://github.com/daliworks/sensorjs/tree/master/example).\n\n## Contributor\n\n[https://github.com/daliworks/sensorjs/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/daliworks/sensorjs/graphs/contributors)\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 [Daliworks Inc](http://www.daliworks.co.kr)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
